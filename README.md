# javascript-try-private-method

A trial implementation for private class method introduced 
[tc39/proposal-class-fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields).

I used browserify and babel for compiling to traditional javascript.

## Build

index.js will be generated:

```sh
$ cd javascript-try-private-method
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## How to run

Just open index.html in your web browser.
